And maybe something more but and don't remember now... so sorry. I made this page a while ago.

# Run it.

It does not matter if you execute first the angular project or the api. But if you run the angular proyect and don't run the api you will see some things are not going to work. So, I recommend first run the api and then run the angular proyect just for make sure.

    * API Node.
       - Install the node_modules. For that you need to execute this command line ````npm install````.
       - You need to execute the file "server.js" like this... ````nodemon server````. Or something like that.
       
       And that it's.

    * Angular.
        - Again, install the node_modules. For that you need to execute this command line ````npm install````.
        - Execute the command line to run the app ````ng serve````.

        And that it's.

# And now we will see if this works.

Now you can go to your preferred browser and go to "localhost:3000". If you don't login with your spotify acount you can't use the most features. So, click in the buton "Login" and you will be redirected to the spotify page to login and then redirected again to the app. And then you will able to use all the page.
